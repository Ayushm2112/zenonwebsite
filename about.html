                        <p>The one who started it all. It takes a lot of guts to create a platform like this and he's the one with all of it. Meet the CEO. Yes, he's got loads of patience and humility. But on that once-in-a day when he breathes fire, no
                            one dares to tread his territory. He's a master manager and rightfully at the helm of affairs at Placement Tree.</p>
